            I’m a developer passionate about crafting <span>accessible, pixel‑perfect user interfaces</span> that merge thoughtful design with clean, maintainable code. I love working at the intersection of <span>design and development</span>, creating seamless digital experiences that are visually engaging and highly performant.

<br><br>

At the same time, I’ve been deeply involved in <span>AI and machine learning</span>, focusing on <span>feature engineering, model optimization, and data‑driven problem‑solving</span>—work that isn’t tied to the web, but rather to building intelligent systems and exploring how to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. This parallel path in AI has sharpened my analytical thinking and given me a strong foundation in <span>turning raw data into well‑structured features that drive better predictions</span>.

<br><br>

<span>With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science</span>, I’ve worked on projects that strengthened both sides of my craft: building intuitive interfaces on one hand, and developing and refining <span>AI models through thoughtful feature engineering</span> on the other. As I grow in my career, I’m excited to take on more challenges, whether they’re in <span>modern front‑end development</span> or <span>AI research and experimentation</span>.

<br><br>

Beyond coding, I’m always exploring new ideas—keeping up with both <span>web trends</span> and <span>AI breakthroughs</span>, experimenting with workflows, and refining my approach to problem‑solving. When I’m not immersed in development, you’ll probably find me <span>reading or learning new technologies.</span>
