            I’m a developer passionate about crafting <span>accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces</span> that merge thoughtful design with clean, maintainable code. My favorite work happens at the intersection of <span>design and development</span>, where I focus on creating seamless digital experiences that are both visually engaging and highly performant.<br><br>
            <span>With a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science</span>, I’ve worked on a couple of projects that have helped me sharpen my skills in <span> modern front-end development</span>. I enjoy building intuitive user interfaces and continuously learning new technologies to improve my craft. As I grow in my career, I’m excited to take on more challenges and contribute to meaningful projects.
            <br><br>
            Beyond coding, I’m always exploring new ideas, keeping up with web trends, and experimenting with ways to improve my workflow. When I’m not immersed in development, you’ll probably find me <span>reading, learning new technologies, or diving into a good video game.</span>
